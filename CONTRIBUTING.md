# Contributing

## Ten rules

1. No runtime dependencies. Dev dependencies only when they earn their place – pinned exactly.
2. English everywhere; text shown to users lives in `src/i18n`. Speaking names instead of comments – a comment
   explains why, never what.
3. Small files, one job per module. Pure functions below, thin components above.
4. Logic is merged with its test. Data checks (songs, grooves) are tests.
5. No `any`, no warnings, zero Sonar findings.
6. Every record in `docs/adr` names what was rejected – the rejected path is the part that gets forgotten.
7. Conventional Commits, small PRs; the description says what, why and how to verify.
8. Merging needs green checks, an up-to-date `main` and one approval; the preview is linked on the PR.
9. Decisions with reach get an ADR in `docs/adr` (date prefix, half a page).
10. Docs are short. What the code says is not repeated next to it.

## Workflow

`npm ci` (enables the git hooks) · `npm run dev` · `npm run check` before pushing · PR against `main`.
